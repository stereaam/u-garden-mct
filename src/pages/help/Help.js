						U-Garden Multi Criteria Tool is a web platform whose main objective
						is to facilitate decision making in the location of urban gardens.
						The application is designed to be an interactive and easy-to-use
						tool that allows any stakeholder or local actor (from public
						administrations to associations) to upload their own data, group the
						variables of interest by dimensions, weight them according to their
						own criteria and obtain a visual result. This result will allow
						users to quickly identify the empty plots that best suit their needs
						and interests for the implementation of an urban garden. In short,
						the application seeks to democratise the process of locating urban
						gardens by providing a platform that allows users to make informed
						decisions based on a set of variables and criteria defined by
						themselves.
